# Flutter Clean Architecture

A well-structured Flutter Clean Architecture project template for building scalable and maintainable mobile applications.



## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the Flutter Clean Architecture repository! This repository provides a structured and scalable architecture for developing Flutter applications. Clean Architecture is a powerful concept that promotes separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. This template incorporates Clean Architecture principles to help you build robust and maintainable Flutter applications.

## ‚≠ê Features

- **Clean Architecture**: The project is structured following the principles of Clean Architecture, which promotes modularity, separation of concerns, and testability.
- **Scalable**: The codebase is organized in a way that makes it easy to scale your application as it grows.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: An example of TDD is provided, demonstrating how to write unit and widget tests for your application.
- **Dependency Injection**: The project uses the `get_it` package for managing dependencies, making it easy to inject dependencies and maintain a clean codebase.
- **State Management**: A simple and effective state management example using the `Bloc` package is included.
- **Theming**: Basic theming is set up with a customizable color palette to help you quickly style your app.
- **Folder Structure**: The project follows a clean and organized folder structure to make it easy to locate and manage your code.

## üí® Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with your Flutter Clean Architecture project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fluttre_clean_coded.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```shell
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Get Dependencies**:

   Run the following command to fetch project dependencies:

   ```shell
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the App**:

   Use the following command to run the app on an emulator or connected device:

   ```shell
   flutter run
   ```

5. **Explore and Customize**:

   Start exploring the codebase, and feel free to customize it to your project's requirements.

## üíØ Architecture Overview

This project follows the Clean Architecture, which consists of three main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This layer contains your UI components, such as widgets, screens, and views.

2. **Domain Layer**: This layer defines the business logic and use cases of your application. It is the core of your app.

3. **Data Layer**: This layer handles data sources and external services, like API calls or database interactions.

## üìù Testing

We believe in the power of testing. The repository includes examples of both unit tests and widget tests to help you get started with Test-Driven Development (TDD).

To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
flutter test
```

## üåª Dependencies

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/): Framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/): The programming language used for Flutter development.
- [Get It](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it): A simple service locator for Dart and Flutter projects.
- [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/Bloc): A state management solution that makes it easy to manage app-wide state.
